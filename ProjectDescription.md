Manor House Property Management System Proposal

1.	Abstract
The idea is coming from the real scenario. I am living in a new construction building, which is located in Lexington, MA and built on 2017. The board is organized in 2018 on March. However, problem keeps coming up, such as maintaining problems, package safety issue, community room schedule conflicts, condo fee payment, board member communication lagging, etc. The board does hire a management company to deal with those things, however, their process is running too slow as they only can be communicated by phone or email and was not able to fix the problem accurately and efficiently. Since that, I believe is better to have a system to organize those issue. I would like to make it as a bridge between management company, residence and the third party, to make the work done conveniently, efficiently and accurately. 

2.	Design Features
Here are the features I would like to have in the system basically.
•	Dash Board – designed to announce upcoming events, alert, monthly newsletter and condo policy
•	Discuss Board – designed for resident to post anecdotes, concerns or whatever they want, for example like, I found the light in lower garage is out of work
•	Chat Thread – designed for trustee to communicate instead of using email thread, the idea is coming from slack
•	Calendar Schedule – designed to book common room, reserve maintain service for the condo, such as dumpster clean, garage clean, fire alarm testing, or elevator inspection, ect. 
•	Payment tool – designed to pay condo fee, common room reserve fee (but here we should concern about the data safety and privacy issue)
